# Cody Work Orders â€” House Rules

- Open a GitHub Issue using **Cody Work Order** template.
- Fill Task type, Branch, Summary, File operations, Commit messages, PR title/body.
- Docs-only changes live under `/docs` (prefer `/docs/ui/**` for design artifacts).
- Cody executes from the issue and posts links to branches/PRs when done.
